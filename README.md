  - With ACE, KAT, ACRE and \~300-360rnd. Of Ammo (NIArms HK416) in mind.

  - All camo patterns were adapted to fit in Arma's terrain with some specific map in mind. (5-Flecktarn for Virolahti, Rosche; 3-Fleck/Digital for All Arid Terrains; Snow for Esseker; Multitarn for Saharani). They might be slightly "off" from the original version; however, I tried to stick with the specific RAL-Tone/Original Fabric (which I was kindly provided with).
  - Ability to Change in between Uniform Version via. ACE-Wardrobe Function.

- All equipment shall have the same color tone/brightness and pattern.
